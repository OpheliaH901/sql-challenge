SQL Challenge (Homework)

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

Data Modeling

By inspecting the 6 .csv files, I was able to create an entity relationship diagram that shows a visual of each entity and the info of each employee, salary, title, and department info and how they all tie together. There isn't one table with all the information to perform an analysis, so developing an ERD helps the flow of our findings

Data Engineering

Once the ERD is created, a script was created to develop each table which is based on the .csv files (found in the EmployeeSQL folder). Using PgAdmin4, i created a Pewlett Hackard database and imported all .csv files, so that the info could be pulled into our tables.
